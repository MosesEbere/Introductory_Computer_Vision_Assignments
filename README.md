## Assignment #1: Comparison of Edge and Corner Detectors

This is a computational assignment that focuses on the implementation and comparison of corner and edge detection algorithms in MATLAB.

## Assignment #2: Camera Calibration

This assignment explores two approaches to calibrating a camera. Firstly, the camera projection matrix is used. This procedure involves manually selecting corners to be used in solving the homogenous
equation involving world coordinates and corresponding image coordinates. The approach applied was singular value decomposition which was used to estimate the projection matrix and then obtain the
extrinsic and intrinsic camera parameters. In the second method, a series of images of a single calibration pattern were taken from different viewpoints. These images served as inputs to the MATLAB
camera calibration app and the required parameters were obtained. Finally, a comparison of the above two methods was done.
